## DHVC 1.0

We proposed hierarchical probabilistic predictive coding, for which hierarchal VAEs are carefully designed to characterize multiscale latent features as a family of flexible priors and posteriors to predict the probabilities of future frames. Under such a hierarchical structure, lightweight networks are sufficient for prediction. The proposed method outperforms representative learned video compression models on common testing videos and demonstrates computational friendliness with much less memory footprint and faster encoding/decoding. Extensive experiments on adaptation to temporal patterns also indicate the better generalization of our hierarchical predictive mechanism. Furthermore, our solution is the first to enable progressive decoding that is favored in networked video applications with packet loss.

## DHVC 2.0

The enhanced Deep Hierarchical Video Compression—DHVC 2.0—has been introduced. This single-model neural video codec operates across a broad range of bitrates, delivering not only superior compression performance to representative methods but also impressive complexity efficiency, enabling real-time processing with a significantly smaller memory footprint on standard GPUs. These remarkable advancements stem from the use of hierarchical predictive coding. Each video frame is uniformly transformed into multiscale representations through hierarchical variational autoencoders. For a specific scale’s feature representation of a frame, its corresponding latent residual variables are generated by referencing lower-scale spatial features from the same frame and then conditionally entropy-encoded using a probabilistic model whose parameters are predicted using same-scale temporal reference from previous frames and lower-scale spatial reference of the current frame. This feature-space processing operates from the lowest to the highest scale of each frame, completely eliminating the need for the complexity-intensive motion estimation and compensation techniques that have been standard in video codecs for decades. The hierarchical approach facilitates parallel processing, accelerating both encoding and decoding, and supports transmission-friendly progressive decoding, making it particularly advantageous for networked video applications in the presence of packet loss. The codes and reference documents will be updated soon.
