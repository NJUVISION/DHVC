# Deep Hierarchical Compression
This repository contains our series of works on Deep Hierarchical Compression.
* DHVC 1.0: The first hierarchical predictive coding method moves away from the hybrid coding framework, achieving best-in-class performance. Paper is available at [Deep Hierarchical Video Compression (AAAI 2024)](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/28733).
* DHVC 2.0: The enhanced hierarchical predictive coding method, which integrates variable-rate intra- and inter-coding into a single model, delivering not only superior compression performance to representative methods but
 also real-time processing with a significantly smaller memory footprint on standard GPUs. Paper is available at [High-Efficiency Neural Video Compression
  via Hierarchical Predictive Learning (arxiv 2024)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02598).

## News
[2025.2.12] We have reconstructed the code and uploaded the pretrained models of [DHVC 1.0](https://github.com/NJUVISION/DHVC/tree/main/dhvc-1.0).
